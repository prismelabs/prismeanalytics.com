# Philosophy

Prisme Analytics follows [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

We favor minimalist and modular software development. We strive to develop
code that is simple, compact, clear, modular and extensible.

This is also apparent in the usage of Prisme Analytics. **We do not strive to be a
one-size-fits-all**, instead we provide [integrations](./03-integrations/00-integrations.md)
with highly customizable tools that can be tailored for your needs.

Nevertheless, Prisme Analytics is a **ready to use** web analytics solution and comes
with reasonable [default](./03-integrations/01-grafana.md#default-dashboard).
