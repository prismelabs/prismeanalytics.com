# What Is Prisme Analytics ?

Prisme Analytics is an **Open Source**, **privacy-focused** and **progressive**
**analytics service**.

Let's see what this means in detail.

## Web Analytics

First and foremost, **web analytics** is the **measurement**, collection,
analysis, and reporting of **web data** to **understand and optimize web usage**.
It can be used to estimate how traffic to a website changes after launching a
new advertising campaign. It helps gauge traffic and popularity trends, which
is useful for market research.

Web Analytics tools do essentially 3 things:
* Collect data
* Store data
* Visualize data

There are [plenty of Web Analytics tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_analytics_software)
such as Google Analytics and Matomo but Prisme Analytics approach is **[unique](../07-philosophy.md)**.

## Users Privacy In Mind

Next, Prisme Analytics is designed with users privacy in mind. We don't collect
personally identifiable information (PII) and we minimize data collection to the
strict necessary.

## Deeply Open Source

Affirming our commitment to user privacy is one aspect; substantiating it is another.
Because Prisme Analytics is in alignment with the Open Source Initiative's (OSI)
[definition of Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd/), you have the
freedom to read, modify, redistribute, and even create your personalized
version of our analytics service.

Prisme Analytics source code and license are available

## Progressive

minutes for basic needs while also being adaptable to meet your specific
requirements.
