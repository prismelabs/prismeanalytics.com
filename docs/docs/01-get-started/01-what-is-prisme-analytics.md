# What Is Prisme Analytics ?

Prisme Analytics is an **Open Source**, **privacy-focused** and **progressive**
**analytics service**.

So what does it mean ?

## Web Analytics

First and foremost, **web analytics** is the **measurement**, collection,
analysis, and reporting of **web data** to **understand and optimize web usage**.
It can be used to estimate how traffic to a website changes after launching a
new advertising campaign. It helps gauge traffic and popularity trends, which
is useful for market research.

## Users Privacy In Mind

Next, Prisme Analytics is designed with users privacy in mind. We don't collect
personally identifiable information (PII) and we minimize data collection to the
strict necessary.

## Deeply Open Source

Affirming our commitment to user privacy is one aspect; substantiating it is another.
Because Prisme Analytics is in alignment with the Open Source Initiative's (OSI)
[definition of Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd/), you have the
freedom to read, modify, redistribute, and even create your personalized
version of our analytics service.
