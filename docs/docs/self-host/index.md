# Self Host Prisme

If you know how (and have the time) to get servers, manage an infrastructure,
perform installation, maintenance, upgrades and monitor servers capacity,
uptime, backups, security, stability, consistency and loading time, you can easily
host your own Prisme instances.

If you're not, please consider using [Prisme Cloud](../get-started/prisme-cloud-vs-self-hosted.md)
our managed service.

:::warning
We do not provide support for self-hosted instances. However, if you have an
issue that seems to be a bug, please submit it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/prismelabs/analytics/issues).
