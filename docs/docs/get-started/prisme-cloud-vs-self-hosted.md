# Prisme Cloud VS Self Hosted

Since March 2024, Prisme Analytics is available as a [managed service](https://app.prismeanalytics.com) (beta stage).

We're seeking for beta testers, if you're interested in using Prisme Analytics
and ready to give us feedbacks, please contact [`hello@prismeanalytics.com`](mailto:hello@prismeanalytics.com) to get
a reduction coupon.

Neverless, if you know how (and have the time) to get servers, manage an infrastructure,
perform installation, maintenance, upgrades and monitor servers capacity,
uptime, backups, security, stability, consistency and loading time, you can easily
host your own Prisme instances.

:::warning
We do not provide support for self-hosted instances. However, if you have an
issue that seems to be a bug, please submit it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/prismelabs/analytics/issues).
:::

If you still choose to self-host Prisme, documentation is available [here](../self-host).

## Where are our servers located?

All of our servers are located in Ireland.
