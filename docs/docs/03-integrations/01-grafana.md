# Grafana

Prisme Analytics is [deeply Open Source and favour the use of existing, specialized and Open Source tools instead of reinventing one](../07-philosophy.md).
That's why we choosed and recommend [Grafana](https://grafana.com) for visualizing
your data.

Using [Grafana](https://grafana.com) for visualization has several advantages:
* Custom dashboards
* Users management
* Teams
* Permissions management
* [Datasource agnostic](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/)
* [Production ready](https://grafana.com/story-of-grafana/)
* De facto standard for data visualization
* Light and [easy to setup](../05-guides/01-setup-grafana.md)

Here is a screenshot of the default Prisme Analytics dashboard setup on start when
