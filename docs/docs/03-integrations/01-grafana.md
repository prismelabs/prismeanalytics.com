# Grafana

Prisme Analytics is [deeply Open Source and favour the use of existing, specialized and Open Source tools instead of reinventing one](../07-contributing/01-philosophy.md)

We choose [Grafana](https://grafana.com) for our dashboard as it is the best
visualization tool and has several advantages:
* Custom dashboards
* Teams
* Permissions management
* [Datasource agnostic](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/)
* [Production ready](https://grafana.com/story-of-grafana/)
* De facto standard for data visualization
* Light and [easy to setup](../05-guides/01-setup-grafana.md)

Here is a screenshot of the default Prisme Analytics dashboard setup on start when
using the [default mode](../02-set-up/01-configuration/01-configure-server/02-default-mode.md).
