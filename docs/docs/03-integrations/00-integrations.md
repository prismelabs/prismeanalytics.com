# Integrations

Prisme Analytics do not strive to [be a one-size-fits-all](../07-philosophy.md) solution.
Instead, it provides integrations with **customizable** tools that are the **best** 
in their domain.

Prisme Analytics comes with 2 kind of integrations:
* **Setup** to prepare other services (database migrations, default dashboard creation) on start.
* **Event store** for storing your analytics data.
