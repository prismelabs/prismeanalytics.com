In today's digital landscape, understanding the impact of your social media
efforts is crucial. As a professional networking platform, LinkedIn offers
unique opportunities for engagement, but tracking the effectiveness of your
posts can be challenging. Let's explore an innovative method to gain deeper
insights into your LinkedIn content performance.

As the innovator behind Prisme and Cutelink, I'm eager to share an effective
method for monitoring link clicks in your LinkedIn posts. This approach combines
URL shorteners, tagged URLs, and web analytics to provide detailed insights into
your LinkedIn engagement. Let's explore this technique!

## The LinkedIn Analytics Challenge

While LinkedIn offers basic metrics, it lacks comprehensive data about link
clicks, especially once users leave the platform. Our technique addresses this
limitation.

## A Comprehensive Solution: Three Key Tools

We'll harness the power of three essential tools:

1. [Cutelink](/tools/url_shortener): Our free URL shortener for creating
   compact, shareable links.
2. [Tagged URLs](/tools/utm_builder): Utilizing UTM parameters or a ref
   parameter to track click sources.
3. Prisme: Our web analytics service that processes UTM parameters and ref
   tracking.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Craft a Tagged URL

Begin with your destination URL and add tracking parameters. Log into Prisme and
navigate to the UTM Builder tool:

Input your details to generate a tagged URL. For those new to UTM parameters,
check out our
[comprehensive guide](/blog/understanding-utm-parameters/#the-anatomy-of-a-utm-parameter).

Example URLs:

```
https://example.com/offer?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=spring_promotion
```

or

```
https://example.com/offer?ref=linkedin_spring_promo
```

### Step 2: Shorten Your URL

Use Cutelink to transform your tagged URL into a concise, LinkedIn-friendly link
that preserves all tracking data.

to measure the performance of your LinkedIn posts accurately.
