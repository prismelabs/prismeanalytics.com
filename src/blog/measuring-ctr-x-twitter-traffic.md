As the creator of Prisme and Cutelink, I'm excited to share a powerful technique
for tracking link clicks in your X posts. This method combines the strengths of
URL shorteners, tagged URLs, and web analytics to give you precise insights into
your X engagement. Let's dive in!

## The Challenge of X Analytics

While X provides some basic analytics, it doesn't offer detailed information
about link clicks, especially once users leave the platform. This is where our
technique comes in handy.

## The Solution: A Three-Pronged Approach

We'll use a combination of three tools:

1. [Cutelink](/tools/url_shortener): Our free URL shortener that creates
   compact, shareable links.
2. [Tagged URLs](/tools/utm_builder): Using UTM parameters or a ref parameter to
   track the source of clicks.
3. Prisme: Our web analytics service that supports UTM parameters and ref
   tracking.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a tagged URL

Start with your destination URL and add UTM parameters or a ref parameter. Login
to Prisme and select UTM Builder under Tools drop menu in navigation bar:

Fill out fields to add UTM parameters to your URL. If you're unfamiliar with UTM
parameters and their meaning, be sure to
[read our post about it](/blog/understanding-utm-parameters/#the-anatomy-of-a-utm-parameter).

For example:

```
https://example.com/page?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=summer_sale
```

or

```
https://example.com/page?ref=twitter_summer_sale
```

### Step 2: Shorten the URL with Cutelink

Take your tagged URL and run it through Cutelink. This will give you a short,
X-friendly link that still contains all the tracking information.

### Step 3: Post on twitter

Use the shortened Cutelink URL in your tweet.

### Step 4: Track with Prisme

As clicks come in, Prisme will capture the UTM or ref parameters, allowing you
to see exactly how many clicks came from your X post.

You can also apply filters for all UTM parameters if you want to see data
related to a specific link.

## Benefits of This Approach

  traffic.

  campaigns.

   tweets are performing best.

simple click counts, giving you actionable insights to refine your social media
